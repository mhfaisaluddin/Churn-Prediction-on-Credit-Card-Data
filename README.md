# Churn Prediction on Credit Card Data
**A credit card** is a payment method that provides convenience in making payments for your financial transactions. Along with this convenience, users may have the opportunity to give a negative impact on service owners, for example ignoring the installments that must be paid and leaving the service.  Through **predictive modeling**, we can classify user churn trends based on service usage characteristics and minimize the churn occurrence by giving a treatment recommendation.
